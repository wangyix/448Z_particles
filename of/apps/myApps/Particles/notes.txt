Arrow keys determine direction of gravity (i.e. up arrow for up, left arrow for left, etc).
Hold mouse to exert an attractive force on all nearby particles.

Findings:

To handle playing sound on collisions, the click will actually play one-frame
after the collision occurs on the screen. This is so that when multiple
collisions occur in one frame, the clicks won't all begin playing immediately.
Each collision will cause a new click to be queued up with up to a frame's
worth of delay (0 <= delay <= dt).  How much delay depends on when the
collision occurred within the update period dt: if it occured early, then the
delay is close to 0; if it occured late, then the delay is closer to dt.


One interesting case is when a ball eventually stopped bouncing and is rolling
around the ground. This causes it to "collide" with the ground every frame and
would cause the click sound to be constantly played.  To address this, a
minimum threshold for the normal component of the velocity of the particle at
impact was added so that any impact below the threshold will not play any
sound.  From experimentation, it was discovered that a good value for this
threshold is 4*g*dt, where g is the acceleration due to gravity and dt is the
time since the last frame.
